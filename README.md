# Sidings Media Railway Controller
This is an opensource project that aims to produce a comprehensive system for the control of a DC model rail of any guage and any scale. It uses Wi-Fi to comunicate with the controlling device. This means that we can have near limitless expansion. The only limit is the number of devices you can have on your network. 


## Plans
At first only a desktop version of the client will be released. It will be released for windows, linux and macOS. Any versions for macOS will be untested due to no machines running such
an operating system being available. For linux the application will be available in .rpm, .deb and .Appimage formats. For windows there will be a .exe installer. After the desktop client 
is at a stable point in development, work will start on the android app. There are no plans as of current for an IOS app due to the lack of availibility of any devices running such an OS.


## The boards
The boards are designed using Easy EDA. This software unfortunatly does not intergrate with git so we may switch to KiCad in future. At the moment, although there are some designs for 
boards on GitHub, the most current designs will be available from the [EasyEda Website](https://easyeda.com/Sidings-Media/). All the designs to do with this project will be prefixed by
 ```Model Railway Control System:```.


## The client software
The client software is designed using the electron framework with a python backend to comunicate with the boards.
