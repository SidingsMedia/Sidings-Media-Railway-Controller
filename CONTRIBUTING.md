# Contribute

## Developing SMRC

Before you contribute it is a good idea for you to create an issue in te correct repo first. This will allow us to discuss the feature before you spend your time on your feature.
Please make sure to submit all pull requests to the projects repositories in the develop branch.
When your working on your contribution please break it out into its own branch and open the pull request against your branch. This makes it much easier for us if you open more pull requests over time.

## Commenting

Please make sure to comment your code! It will make is a lot easier in the long run when other people need to develop your code. If your code isn't commented we won't be able to accept your contribution.

## Pull request guidelines
Please make sure to reference the issue which your PR addresses. This will mean that Github will link your PR to the issue making it easier to trace in the future. Please make sure to provide details of what your PR does both technically and functionally. If your contribution changes the UI please provide screenshots of the change.

## Developer Certificate of Origin (DC0)

All contributions (including pull requests) must agree to the Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO) version 1.1. This is exactly the same one created and used by the Linux kernel developers and posted on http://developercertificate.org/. A copy of this can also be found in the project root (DCO_V1.1) or by writing to [contact@sidingsmedia.com](mailto:contact@sidingsmedia.com?subject=SMRC%20DCO). This is a developer's certification that he or she has the right to submit the patch for inclusion into the project. Simply submitting a contribution implies this agreement, however, please include a "Signed-off-by" tag in every patch (this tag is a conventional way to confirm that you agree to the DCO).

A copy of this can be found in the project root (CODE_OF_CONDUCT.md) or by writing to [contact@sidingsmedia.com](mailto:contact@sidingsmedia.com?subject=SMRC%20Code%20of%20Conduct). Simply submitting a contribution implies this agreement.
