Licence
-------

All official SMRC projects (i.e all in the table above), use the
`REUSE`_ standard in order to communicate the correct licence for the
file. For those unfamiliar with the standard the licence for each file
can be found in one of three places. The licence will either be in a
comment block at the top of the file, in a ``.license`` file with the
same name as the file, or in the dep5 file located in the ``.reuse``
directory. If you are unsure of the licencing terms please email 
`contact@sidingsmedia.com`_.
