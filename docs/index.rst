Boards
======

The boards for SMRC provide the physical bridge between the hardware and software. They are the
devices that control the trains on the track and lights in the model houses.

Clients
=======

Just as the boards provide the physical interface between the software and the trains, the 
clients provide the bridge between the user and the software. They provide easy to use 
interfaces to allow the user to control their model railway from the comfort of their device.
