Style guide
===========

Code
----

In order to help keep our code readable and easy to understand, we apply
style guides to all of the SMRC repositories. These are the same guides
that are used by Google and a list of all of them can be found in their
`google/styleguide`_ repository. To make it easier there is a table
below that contains all of the language style guides that apply.

+------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| Language   | Style sheet                                           |
+============+=======================================================+
| TypeScript | https://google.github.io/styleguide/tsguide.html      |
+------------+-------------------------------------------------------+
| C++        | https://google.github.io/styleguide/cppguide.html     |

| HTML/CSS   | https://google.github.io/styleguide/htmlcssguide.html |

Schematics
----------

All of the schematics for the project should use the template file
located in the root of the `SMRC-hardware`_ repository called
``pageLayout.kicad_wks``. This helps to make sure that all of our
schematics follow the same design and makes sure that all the required
information is included.
