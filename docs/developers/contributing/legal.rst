Contributor Covenant Code of Conduct
------------------------------------

This project operates a code of conduct in order to ensure that the
project remains an inclusive and supportive environment for anyone and
everyone who wishes to contribute to the project in any way. You can
find a copy of the `code of conduct`_ in the main repository for the
project, `SidingsMedia/Sidings-Media-Railway-Controller`_. By
participating in this project you agree to abide by its terms. 

Developer Certificate of Origin
-------------------------------

In order to ensure that all of the code contributed to the repositories
is the work of the contributor or that the contributor has the correct
permissions to submit the work. It is the same DCO that is used for the
Linux kernel and it can be found in the file called ``DCO_V1.1`` in the
root of each official SMRC repository. You can also see the terms at
`developercertificate.org`_. To demonstrate that you accept the DCO and
that you are permitted to contribute the work, you should add a sign off
line at the end of your commit message in the following form: 

.. code-block:: none

    Signed-off-by: Full Name <email>

You can automatically add this to the end of your commit message by
adding the ``--signoff`` option to ``git commit``. If you use VS Code
then you can enable the ``git.alwaysSignOff`` option in your settings.
For more information on how to contribute to a project that uses a DCO
you should see the `Developer Certificate of Origin (DCO)`_
documentation made available by `The Linux Foundation`_.
