Contributing
############

Being an opensource project, we love it when people want to contribute,
after all, it's the best part of being opensource, anyone can pitch in
to create the best application possible. This section gives you some
more information on the whole proccess from selecting which features to
work on to finally getting your code merged into the project. There is
no need to worry if it's your first time contributing to a project, we
were all new once, if you need any more help then check out the
`SMRC-help`_ gitter room or email us at contact@sidingsmedia.com. For
more information on contributing opensource projects in general you
should check out `How to Contribute to Open Source`_ for an overview and
the GitHub docs on `how to create a Pull Request`_ for some more
technical information.
